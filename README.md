## Project Title
### Assessing the effectiveness of using Fourier Transformed features of ultrasound images in predicting the presence of blood within the knee joint space


## Description
In this project, we have presented an alternate method in determining the presence of blood within the knee joint by using Fourier Transformation to generate image features from ultrasound images. We used these Fourier transformed features and an SVM to perform the classification task of blood yes/no. We compared this approach to the current model which uses human engineered features to determine the presence of blood within the knee joint. In the experiments, the proposed model performs better than the current model in all of the evaluation metrics considered, leading us to believe that it is a good avenue to keep doing further work in.
